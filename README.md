#### Show navigation bar

This module will show navigation bar (for LMT or other gesture app users).
Tested on Android 8.1 Oreo ROM (Google Pixel 2 XL).

#### How does it works?

This module sets "qemu.hw.mainkeys" property to "0", which means "this device does not have hardware navigation key and we should show navigation bar".

#### NOTICE
